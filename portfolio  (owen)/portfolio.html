          <h2> Hi ! I am Owen Chong !</h2>
          <p>I was born in Penang, Malaysia which is a beautiful island that famous with the cultural and natural view. The first time i picked up a camera was at the early age of sixteen- influenced by self-portraiture and conceptual photography. Growing up with the rise of social media and digital techniques provide me more chances to learn and gain new experience on photograph. After graduating from college, i start to travel over the whole Malaysia for the amazing and woderful natural views in this country.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In Malaysia, we have a multicultural society with rich cultural heritage and everyone live harmoniously in this country. Diversity of races, religions and cultures is a significant characteristic of our nation. I love to take pictures of happy people and be the part of their story.</p>

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Photography can be taken literally and not so literally. Literally speaking, photography is a document, now used more often to state, "I am here," "I exist," "Be apart of my life," "know who I am." And if you don't know how to take a picture, it's considered unusual. Not so literally speaking, photography is a magical box, which captures light and you can do whatever you please with your captured light.</p>
          <br>
          <p>When I hold my camera to my face and look through the glass to see my subject gazing back at me, the world around me goes silent, and from the moment I start my set of images, to the moment I've finished editing them, I feel free. I've created something. I've grown as an artist. And that is my accomplishment.</p>
