			<div class="container">
				<div class="intro">Hello, I'm Ryan Yap, a 19 year old boy born and raised input
					 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I consider myself an introvert and like to shut myself indoors with my
					 computer and smartphone (aha jokes).
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="intro"> I aspire to be someone like Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft) and Phil Chen
				(one of HTC Vives' inventors) as they revolutionzed the way humans use technology. But on the way
				there, I plan to do the best I can in my studies while at the same time, balancing my social life
				and other activities.

			<div class="container2" align="center">
				<div class="edu">I attended my primary years at SJK(C)Jalan Davidson, Kuala Lumpur from 2007 till 2012. I was fortunate
				enough to go there as it was considered as a top tier primary school by many. The facilities were excellent, the teachers
				were friendly and have good teaching abilities. The only downside is having to drive throug traffic to get there. Every.
				Single. Morning.

				<img src="images/primaryschool.jpg" align="center" class="sec3images">
				<br><br>
				<div class="edu">For my secondary education (years 2013 till 2017) I attended Campus Rangers, an international school and home-schooling center
					where I was taught the IGCSE, O-Level syllabus. Many of my important friendships started and fostered here. It was also where I decided to
					take up a technology related course for my further studies. In secondary school is where I also realised how important friends are and to make
					sure to never let the good ones go.
				</div>
				<br>
				<img src="images/graduation.png" align="center" class="sec3images">
				<br><br>
				<div class="edu">After high school, I moved on to take on a Diploma in Software Engineerng (still ongoing since 2018) at Asia Pacific University of
					technology & Innovation (APU). The same as my previous educations, I'm trying my best to achieve good GPA scores. I also intend on making many
					friends from other cultures and races here as APU is a well-known international university.

		<h2 class="educationtitle" align="center"><u>Hobbies</u></h2>
			<div class="container2">
				<img src="images/rubiks.png" class="rubiksimage">
				<div class="rubiksdesc"> As you can already tell from my introduction, one of my most favoured activities to pass time, is playing the Rubiks Cube.
					I started playing since I was 11 and never stopped since. In total, I have more than 30 different forms and variations of Rubiks Cubes. My
					fastest record for a typical Rubiks Cube (3x3) is 23 seconds. I can get even faster if I weren't so lazy to learn the rest of the formulas.
					I chose to learn and to play the Rubiks Cube even though it was very time consuming to learn, was because it helps me release stress and train
					my memory and reaction times which could help me in real life situations.
				</div>
				<img src="images/game.png" class="gameimage">
				<div class="gamedesc"> During long periods of free time at home, I would either fire up my computer or smartphone and play video games to burn time.
					I play video games of all genre, but I'm no professional. Lately, I've been spending a lot of time with a group of close friends playing games such
					as PUBG (Players' Unknown Battlegrounds) and Werewolf (A mind-strategy game). We would stay up all night long and just keep on playing. To me, its
					not about winning or losing, but having fun with the people around you.
				</div>
				<img src="images/music.png" class="musicimage">
				<div class="musicdesc"> The last hobby I'm mentioning would be the hobby of many other people; Listening to music. I listen to all kinds of music genres
					through Spotify, regardless of song language. It doesn't matter when I'm on the bus, doing some work, or even doing nothing, I bring around a set of
					earphones with me so that wherever I go, I can enjoy	my music with me without disturbing other people. My 2 current favourite songs are <a href=
					"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hH0nyAXtwU" target="_blank">'Lighthouse' by Juliette Irons</a>, and the Mandarin song <a href="https://youtu.be/rHphcJCw_Ok?t=68"
					target="_blank">'他不懂' by '张杰' (Jason Zhang)</a>. For music, my current favourite title is the instrumental version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYdEymHfWIs"
					target="_blank">'Calling Crows'by AllttA</a>.
